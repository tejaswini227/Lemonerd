# Lemonerd
UI design project for my blog site.
Lemonerd is an honest and ambitious effort to share the collective interest and enthusiasm for technology, science and the millennial culture. The website and contents have been created from scratch by us. The blogs and editorials shared on this platform are a reflection of what inspires and excites a young inquisitive mind. The idea of the blogging site is to provide insightful content that is interesting, light, informative and satiates the interests of any info-enthusiast.
